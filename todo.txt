1. Better report page. Currently working on a pretty table+CSS with a delete button for each row.
2. Better options page to control each option such as blacklist, dontbugme list, report automatically etc.
3. Better way to input minutes to disable Appu.
4. Report ready currently opens a new tab after due time. It continues to do so for every 5 minutes after that.
   Instead, blur the current tab that the user is on and popup with options "Review and Send report", "Send report",
   "Remind me in 30 minutes". Also on the reports page, add a checkbox for sending reports automatically.
5. When Appu is enabled from disable state, have a small popup that blinks a few times.
6. Password bloom filter for checking in cracked-passwords-db (Collected passwords from Elaine).
7. Categorize websites as per security rings. Change the color of warning popup from dim red to yellow hot depending
   on the ring.
8. Make a better application webpage on 'appu.gtnoise.net'
9. A chrome-store page for Appu to give authenticity.
10. Auto-updating or One-click updating. Check for updates and warn user to download new version.
11. New icon for Appu (talking to a graphic designer). 
12. Add transperency alpha level for Appu icon in browser.
13. Archive report.
14. Open source license at the top of each file.
15. Rearrange git repo. Make js/css/html folders. Rearrange files. Delete extra jquery and jqueryui folders.
16. Firefox extension.
17. IE extension.
18. requirejs for faster loading of js.
